# Polynomial-calculator

This is an application which act as a polynomial calculator, being able to do different kind of operations on monomials and polynomials such as: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, derivative and integration.
An important aspect of this app is to realize a functional interface easy to use by inexperienced users in the field of programming, with simple indications for each utility of the program.
The application will manage the two polynomials entered by the user and will display in a predefined space the result. 
The user communicates with the interface through its buttons.
In order to reach the objective, I aimed to solve the following problems:
-	Division of the program into classes
-	Processing of polynomials in a text format (String type)
-	Creating the graphical user interface (GUI)
-	Development of algorithms for functions dealing with polynomial operations
-	Conversion from polynomial back to text (to display)
-	Testing the program with JUnit
